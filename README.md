# IBO - I'LL BE OKAY

> This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the *System Identification and Parameter Estimation* (TIP7044) course at the Federal University of CearÃ¡ during my Master's degree. 

## Application Description ðŸ’»

Development of an IoT-based crop management tool enabling efficient remote planting control. Utilizing pumps and solenoids as actuators, and temperature and humidity sensors. A Raspberry Pi serves as a data aggregation hub and remote command executor. Features include easy analysis and visualization of the greenhouse conditions, monitoring and notifications about the plant's status, as well as alerts in case of malfunctions.

### System Architecture Description

## Materials

For the project in question, two sensors were used: **DHT11** and a **Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor Module**.

- **DHT11** - Sensor used to measure air temperature and humidity. It has an accuracy of +- 2Â°C and +- 5.0%. Furthermore, it is a sensor recommended for systems where temperature and humidity variations are, respectively, in the ranges of 0 to 50Â°C and 20 to 90%.

- **Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor Module** - As the name suggests, the sensor is used to measure soil moisture variation. It offers a longer lifespan and resistance to corrosion compared to resistive models.

To perform the collection, processing, and storage (per hour) of information, the chosen embedded system was the **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**. The Raspbian operating system (Linux-based) was chosen and installed on the device.

It is important to note that one of the sensors used, specifically the one that measures soil moisture, produces an analog output signal. However, the Raspberry does not have analog ports. Thus, the **MCP3008** was used, which is an 8-channel A/D converter. It has a 10-bit resolution and uses the SPI protocol to communicate with the microcomputer.

Python was the programming language adopted for the implementation of the sensor configuration and reading codes. The codes are executed directly by the Raspberry terminal.

Initially, a code for the calibration of the capacitive sensor was implemented. Then, a single code was used to read both the air humidity and temperature sensors and the soil moisture sensor.

The IoT platform chosen for the development of the project in question was Cayenne. MQTT was the communication protocol used to establish the connection for sending information from the device to the platform server.

![Cayenne platform](Figures/cayenne-platform.png)

Initially, for the code development that establishes communication between the device and the platform, the **paho.mqtt.client** library was used. The information taken from the platform to set up the connection were:

- user: db5a8060-3e2b-11ec-8da3-474359af83d7
- password: f56e60c61d27ffb784d9a78e776c19e695314deb
- client_id: 8a3d3e70-7a4e-11ec-a681-73c9540e1265 (**changes from device to device**)
- server: mqtt.mydevices.com
- port: 1883

It was necessary to implement the following command lines to connect the device to the platform:
```
client = mqtt.Client(client_id) # Instance that will connect with MyDevices
client.username_pw_set(user,password) # Requirements for connection
client.connect(server,port) # Establishes the connection
```
After establishing the connection between the Raspberry and the platform, the necessary configurations were made to enable the sending of information to the server. Widgets were created for the dashboard by configuring through which channels the data would be sent (Figure 15). And with that, a command was implemented for each sensor with the following structure:
```
client.publish('v1/username/things/clientID/data/channel', variable_name)
```
